    "text": "This is the github repos that contains the backend content for the website (https://berkeley-ids.github.io/seminarseries.html).\nThe website is based on Quarto (https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) files. Quarto is based on markdown script, which it links together authomatically and compiles into html content. Quarto files end with .qmd; there are also important “yaml” files that have endings .yml or .yaml that govern characteristics of the website.\nTo edit the files and test out how your changes will look locally, I recommend using RStudio. It will compile the files by pushing button Render and create a local copy of what the website looks like. However, this requires downloading R etc, so if you don’t have a RStudio setup already, editing can be done in other editors. If you visit https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/, they will walk through how to work with quarto in your choice of editor (VSCode, Jupyter, or just a text editor).\nTo actually compile the changes so they show up on the website you can do this in two ways:\n\nOn your local machine: This assumes you are making edits on your machine from a clone of the repository that resides on your machine. Then within the directory with the git repos, run quarto publish gh-pages in a terminal within your berkeley-ids.github.io directory. Information on how to compile it and push it to the proper place in github can be found here: https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/github-pages.html (we use method two quarto publish gh-pages). All the setup is already in place, so the main thing a new editor needs to do is to download quarto (https://quarto.org/docs/download/). Some editors, like RStudio, provide capability to do the online publishing within the editor as well (see quarto documentation for details).\nOn github website: Go to the “Actions” tab. On the left-hand side you should see a workflow action called “Manually Render and Publish”. Click on this. In the main part of the screen, you should see This workflow has a workflow_dispatch event trigger. and to the far right of that a drop down menu that says Run workflow. Click on Run workflow, make sure the master branch is chosen, and click on Run workflow. At this time we only have it set up to be manually compiled, but a “to-do” item would be to create a workflow that runs automatically every week (for example to update the “Upcoming events” to show only upcoming events)\n\nIn addition, you need to actually commit your changes to the quarto files and push them to github’s master branch so they are available for everyone. Otherwise, other people might make edits and work with an older version of the website. This is separate from the publishing step (which pushes the compiled version to the gh-pages branch, which is where github pulls from for the website.)\nA note about branches: you shouldn’t be working on the branch gh-pages, except through the quarto publish command. Make sure you are always in the master branch when you are editing."

In this folder there is a folder for each speaker, which should contain one file called index.qmd and (optionally) one image file of the speaker.\nTo add a new speaker, create a folder for them, and then create/add these two files. If you are working directly on GitHub, to create a new folder click on a button to create a new file and type folder1/file1 to create a file with name file1 within folder folder1. So for example, you would type the name of your new file as 2026-John_Doe/index.qmd.\nFor the index.qmd file, copy the text from another existing folder, and just update the following components:\n\nThe header should look like this, with this information updated for the speaker:\n\n---\ntitle: \"Ever Since Allais and Ellsberg\"\nauthor: \n  - name: Shachar Kariv\n    affiliation: Department of Economics\ndate: '2026-02-02'\nimage: shachar.jpg\ncategories: \"Spring 2026\"\n---\nThe image entry should be the name of the image file of the speaker that is in the same folder. * The text for the Abstract should be added in the appropriate space after the header. * No other text should be changed in the file image.qmd."

For human-driven platforms, the challenge lies in managing strategic agent behavior; for autonomous fleets, the bottleneck is the computational scalability of large-scale fleet control. This seminar presents two frameworks—grounded in information design and deep reinforcement learning—that address spatial resource allocation in these distinct paradigms.\nFirst, we examine strategic information design in networks where agents strategically reposition to maximize their payoffs in face of demand shocks. Modeling this as a network game, we characterize optimal information disclosure mechanisms and establish that, in many practical settings, simple “monotone partitional” mechanisms are optimal for maximizing platform revenue and minimizing system costs. Second, we address the operational control of large-scale electric robo-taxi fleets, spanning ride matching, repositioning, and charging. To overcome the curse of dimensionality, we introduce Atomic Proximal Policy Optimization (Atomic-PPO), which decomposes the fleet dispatching problem into constant-dimension sequential assignments. We prove this decomposition is without loss of optimality for a wide variety of stochastic network control problems.\nFinally, we validate both frameworks using real-world data from the New York City for-hire vehicle market. Our findings illustrate how strategic signaling with scalable control policies significantly enhances the efficiency and sustainability of urban mobility systems.\n\n\n\n\nManxi Wu"
